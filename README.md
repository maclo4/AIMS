# AIMS
Automated Indoor Mapping System for the Misty II Robot. This was created while I was working at The Car Lab as a student research assistant. The goal of the project was basically to make a program that would allow the Misty II robot to create maps of rooms without the need for a human to manually drive her around. The best comparison is how roombas roam around and make maps as they go.

## Hazard Avoidance

When using my program, Misty is able to detect and avoid obstacles in her way. For the video above, I placed objects close to her front and back to se if she would successfully find her way out.

## Retracing Steps

Unlike Roombas, Misty can only map for 5-10 minutes at a time. This means the roaming pattern has to be efficient at viewing as much of the room as possible. I made a feature that allows her to drive in a direction, then retrace back to where she started, turn, then explore in a different direction.

This was too long to fit into a gif, it shows what the program looks like from start to finish of making a map.
